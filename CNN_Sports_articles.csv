How Inter Milan defied the odds to reach the Champions League final

After 120 minutes of pure drama, magical moments and stunning performances, there is only one thing we know for sure: few will be sleeping in Milan tonight.
Last week’s first leg – which finished 3-3 – was incredible, but somehow this return match was even better.
Inter Milan started far the stronger of the two sides and raced into a 2-0 lead at half-time through Lautaro Martínez’s opener and Hakan Çalhanoğlu’s penalty.
Barcelona looked way off it in the opening 45 minutes and knew it needed something special in the second half to get itself back into contention – and that’s exactly what the Spanish giant produced.
In less than six minutes, Barça had leveled the scoreline through Eric García’s fine finish and Dani Olmo’s header, as the San Siro was stunned into silence.
Then, with the
Blaugrana
dominating the ball, the visitors thought they had scored a late winner when Raphinha fired a shot into the bottom corner of the net in the 88th minute.

That seemed to be it, there was no way Inter could muster enough energy to find another goal and Barça fans must have started looking at flights to the final in Munich.
But then, in the 93rd minute, Francesco Acerbi sent
Nerazzurri
fans into a frenzy after smashing the ball into the roof of Barcelona’s net to level the scores.
Acerbi, 37, was in tears and pointed to the sky after scoring his first ever Champions League goal as mayhem played out around him.
Extra-time then loomed for both sides, but it was Inter who got the better of it, spurred on by the home support.
The winning goal came in the 99th minute after brilliant hold up play by striker Marcus Thuram, who laid the ball off to Davide Frattesi in the box. The midfielder kept his composure to guide his shot into the corner of the net to send the Italian side into dreamland.
“What happened? I don’t know! I celebrated so loudly that my head was spinning,” Frattesi said after the game.

But, naturally, Barça wasn’t done and almost found another equalizer in the final moments of extra-time. First, Robert Lewandowski headed just over the bar from a couple meters out, before Inter goalkeeper Yann Sommer produced a world-class save to deny Lamine Yamal’s effort from nestling into the back of the net.
“I’m very happy, we played an incredible match. Which save will I remember? The last one on Lamine Yamal; he is a great player and, fortunately, it didn’t go in,” Player of the Match Sommer said.
“Many teams would have given up after going down 3-2, but we didn’t and managed to come back.”
After tonight’s win, you feel it was destiny for Inter Milan to reach the Champions League final where it will meet either PSG or Arsenal.
The second semifinal is set for Wednesday night and CNN Sports will be across all the action live once again.
Key Stat:
This was the joint-highest scoring semifinal tie in Champions League history, along with Liverpool’s 7-6 win against Roma in 2018.

'I'm proud of Inter,' Lautaro Martínez says after reaching Champions League final

Inter Milan captain Lautaro Martínez will have the chance to right the wrongs of two years ago when he and the Italian side take the pitch in Munich, Germany for the Champions League final.
The
Nerazzurri
lost 1-0 to Manchester City in 2023 but will again be able to win a fourth European Cup and first since Jose Mourinho led the team to Champions League glory in 2010.
“Incredible. I’m so happy,” he told Prime Sport. “I’m thankful for my family, for everyone here. I’m proud of Inter.
“We’ll do everything we can, we have one last step left. Just as we reached Istanbul two years ago, today we’re in a final again. We did a great job, we just need to finish that last bit.
“We’ll prepare, finish our (domestic) championship, and then we’ll think about another final and try to take this club to the greatest heights.”
Martínez was a doubt for the second leg after going off injured in the first with an apparent hamstring issue.
The Argentine admitted he wasn’t at full fitness tonight, but said he was determined to play and help the team.
“The truth is I was really bad, really sad, but with the medical team and all the staff we did a great job,” Martínez revealed.
“Although I wasn’t at 100%, I wanted to be on the pitch with my teammates and thanks to God, they’ve given me this joy of returning to play in a Champion League final.”

Trump announces Rudy Giuliani’s son will lead World Cup task force

Half a world away from the San Siro, some key moves were announced for next year’s World Cup – which will likely feature many of the players who were on the pitch tonight.
President Donald Trump on Tuesday announced new appointments to the task force that is coordinating preparations for the 2026 World Cup.
Trump announced that Andrew Giuliani, the son of former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani and a longtime Trump aide, will serve as the executive director of the Presidential Task Force on the 2026 World Cup. Carlos Cordeiro, a former president of US Soccer and currently a senior adviser at FIFA, will serve as Giuliani’s senior adviser.
Giuliani, who was a former gubernatorial candidate in New York, served in Trump’s first administration as a special assistant to the president and was associate director of the Office of Public Liaison. Trump noted that he helped coordinate the reentry of foreign professional athletes who ply their trade in the United States during the Covid-19 pandemic.
During the first meeting of the task force on Tuesday, Trump praised Giuliani as a competitive person and an accomplished golfer.
“He’s a highly competitive golfer, by which I mean really good,” Trump said. “And he’s also a highly competitive person, and he loves what we’re doing. So, I want to congratulate you and your family and your father, your great father, who’s the greatest mayor in the history of New York. So, I want to congratulate the family.”
He added with a laugh, “It’s a big post, you better do well, Andrew.”
The task force is largely made up of members of Trump’s Cabinet and Vice President JD Vance is serving as vice chairman. Other members of the task force include Sens. Shelley Moore Capito and Todd Young, Reps. Darin LaHood and Bryan Steil.

Was that the greatest Champions League tie of all time?

Incredible. Remarkable. Ridiculous. It seems unlikely that words will ever do justice to the tie we have just witnessed.
That was unquestionably one of the greatest Champions League ties in history. It might even be
the
greatest.
It had absolutely everything. There was a glut of goals, end-to-end action, comebacks for both teams, nerve-racking VAR reviews and a raucous atmosphere.
In a tie that had 13 goals, you probably wouldn’t expect the goalkeepers to get a shoutout, but Inter’s Yann Sommer made 14 saves across the two legs – and his 14th was perhaps the pick of the bunch.

The Swiss international strained every sinew to reach Lamine Yamal’s goal-bound effort in extra time and tip the ball around the post. Talk about saving your best ‘til last.
Another wonderful storyline in a wild semifinal came courtesy of Inter defender Francesco Acerbi, who scored the equalizer for Inter three minutes into added time.
At 37 years of age and after 20 seasons in professional soccer, Acerbi scored his first Champions League goal to send the game to extra-time and make himself an unlikely hero.
