    "markdown": "That’s another million-dollar question.\n\n* * *\n\n[![](https://www.thezimbabwean.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/20250109_131642-1854x2048.jpg)](https://www.thezimbabwean.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/20250109_131642-scaled.jpg)\n\nTendai Ruben Mbofana\n\nI recently had a very enlightening conversation with a former cabinet minister from the post-independence government of Zimbabwe.\n\nOver time, we have developed a strong friendship, and each discussion we have is an eye-opener into the tragic direction our country has taken.\n\nDuring our latest exchange, this once-prominent figure in national leadership expressed sheer disbelief at the rot we now call governance in Zimbabwe.\n\nHe had just returned from a professional engagement, where he had been surrounded by some of the world’s most brilliant minds—an experience that cast into stark contrast the mediocrity that has come to define our national leadership.\n\nTo directly receive articles from Tendai Ruben Mbofana, please join his WhatsApp Channel on: [https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029VaqprWCIyPtRnKpkHe08](https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029VaqprWCIyPtRnKpkHe08)\n\nHis insights were as disturbing as they were sobering.\n\nHe expressed utter dismay at how a government that once genuinely cared for its people soon after independence had now sunk to the lowest depths of primitive governance.\n\nThis collapse is evident across all sectors.\n\nZimbabwe still suffers from near-daily 18-hour power outages.\n\nHow is a nation supposed to develop under such conditions?\n\nIndustries are crippled.\n\nSmall businesses that cannot afford expensive fuel for generators are shutting down.\n\nChildren cannot study at night. Hospitals cannot operate life-saving equipment.\n\nAnd all the while, those in power sit in their air-conditioned homes powered by solar systems and generators paid for by taxpayers.\n\nThey do not experience the anguish and desperation of ordinary Zimbabweans.\n\nThen there are our roads—most of which were built during the colonial era.\n\nToday, these roads have become impassable.\n\nPotholes so large they could swallow an entire wheel.\n\nStreets that more closely resemble war zones than avenues of economic activity.\n\nYet, year after year, the government collects millions of dollars from toll fees and vehicle licences to fund road rehabilitation, and still nothing changes.\n\nWhere does the money go? Who is benefiting?\n\nOf course, one cannot speak of Zimbabwe’s dysfunction without mentioning the appalling state of public health institutions.\n\nHospitals have become death traps.\n\nBasic painkillers are unavailable. Patients are asked to bring their own syringes, bandages, and medication.\n\nCancer and dialysis machines are either broken or nonexistent. Ambulances are scarce. Pregnant women die in labor for lack of care.\n\nThis is the cruel reality.\n\nIt was particularly bizarre that on the eve of a Tuesday cabinet meeting, the Minister of Youth, Tino Machakaire, took to X (formerly Twitter) to express shock at the deplorable conditions of a hospital he visited to see a sick relative.\n\nHe went as far as inviting the president to visit these institutions himself.\n\nWhile the gesture might seem noble, it raises serious questions.\n\nWhy resort to public displays of dismay when he was due to meet the president and fellow ministers the very next day in cabinet?\n\nIf he genuinely cares, why not raise these issues within government structures where real action can be initiated?\n\nOr does he know—like the rest of us suspect—that cabinet meetings have become nothing more than formalities, where nothing of national benefit is ever discussed?\n\nBecause if Machakaire truly believed that cabinet meetings were effective, he would have no need to post on social media.\n\nHis tweet, in fact, exposes just how hollow and performative our government has become.\n\nMinisters, it seems, would rather grandstand in public than speak frankly in meetings designed for decision-making.\n\nAnd one has to wonder: what, then, is the purpose of these cabinet meetings held every Tuesday?\n\nWhat do these men and women discuss while the country burns?\n\nJudging by the collapse in every sector of national life, it’s clear that they do not discuss solutions.\n\nThey do not debate developmental strategies. They do not review research or consult experts. They do not even listen to each other.\n\nFrom all indications, their Tuesdays are likely spent scheming on how to loot national resources, protect their political positions, and tighten their grip on power.\n\nIt would be laughable if it were not so tragic.\n\nEven the rampant armed robberies across the country can be traced to this failure.\n\nNobody trusts banks anymore, and citizens keep cash at home—ripe targets for criminals.\n\nYet this is a government that, week after week, ignores the growing lawlessness while focusing on laws to silence critics and opposition parties.\n\nThe disconnect is glaring.\n\nWe have a government that doesn’t plan.\n\nIt reacts—badly and too late.\n\nWe have ministers who are not moved by suffering unless it touches their own families.\n\nWe have a cabinet that meets, but never leads.\n\nEven more shocking is the silence of cabinet on rampant high-level corruption.\n\nIs there even an attempt during these meetings to discuss the billions of taxpayers’ dollars siphoned off in scandal after scandal?\n\nFor instance, South African authorities recently revealed that R1.1 billion was transferred to Ren-Form CC, a company across the border, supposedly for procurement purposes.\n\nYet, within days, R800 million of that was funneled into business accounts linked to convicted criminal and tenderpreneur Wicknell Chivayo.\n\nIs this not something worthy of serious cabinet scrutiny?\n\nOr do they look the other way because the real beneficiaries of this systematic looting are within their own ranks, while characters like Chivayo merely act as errand boys?\n\nWhen a government can’t be bothered to investigate or even acknowledge such egregious abuse of public funds, then we know that corruption has been fully institutionalized.\n\nOne of the issues we also spoke about was the recent and frankly embarrassing phenomenon of drilling boreholes in urban areas as a supposed solution to the ongoing water crisis.\n\nThe former minister aptly described these efforts as mere band-aid measures, devoid of any meaningful strategy.\n\nWhat struck him most was how such infantile ideas could even make it into national policy discussions.\n\nHow can anyone seriously believe that drilling boreholes in Redcliff, a town with a population requiring long-term urban planning, is a solution?\n\nIt is the thinking of people who have no understanding of development, planning, or investment.\n\nIndeed, what benchmarks are our leaders using?\n\nCities like Harare were designed by colonial planners for far smaller populations.\n\nToday, Harare’s population has more than quadrupled, yet the water and sanitation infrastructure has remained unchanged.\n\nIt does not take a Harvard graduate to understand that such a mismatch creates a breeding ground for diseases, especially in overcrowded areas like Mbare.\n\nThe tsikidzi infestation—tiny bugs symbolizing decay and filth—is a metaphor for the collapse of hygiene and living standards in Zimbabwe, and a vivid reminder of a government that has completely failed its people.\n\nZimbabwe’s tragic story is not the result of sanctions or global economic downturns.\n\nIt is the direct consequence of a government that has long ceased to care, and that no longer functions in the service of its people.\n\nThe real question, then, is not what our cabinet discusses every Tuesday.\n\nThe real question is: how much longer will Zimbabweans tolerate a government that does not even pretend to govern?\n\n- **_Tendai Ruben Mbofana is a social justice advocate and writer.

HSTv has also been charged.\n\nMhlanga was twice denied bail, first by a magistrate and on appeal at the High Court before his latest bid for freedom.\n\nJustice Mandaza shot down prosecution arguments that Mhlanga would abscond, ruling that this can be addressed by imposing conditions.\n\nSaid the judge: “After hearing submissions by both counsel, this court is of the view that the appellant is entitled to bail.\n\n“The appellant is be hereby granted bail. He is ordered to deposit US$500 bail not US$200 as has been suggested by his counsel.”\n\nMandaza also ordered Mhlanga not to interfere with witnesses and to continue residing at his given address until his matter is finalised.\n\nThe journalist was ordered to surrender his passport with the clerk of court and to report at the police once every Friday at CID Law and Order.\n\nMhlanga’s arrest drew worldwide condemnation and activist in London, United Kingdom, had announced plans to confront first lady Auxillia Mnangagwa when she attends a conference there in June.\n\nPost published in: [Featured](https://www.thezimbabwean.co/category/featured/)\n\n### Related\n\n- [Health ministry lashes out at Machakaire’s ‘unwarranted’ criticism over state of hospitals](https://www.thezimbabwean.co/2025/05/health-ministry-lashes-out-at-machakaires-unwarranted-criticism-over-state-of-hospitals/ \"Health ministry lashes out at Machakaire’s ‘unwarranted’ criticism over state of hospitals\")\n- [Mr. President, Zimbabwe doesn’t have a national dress](https://www.thezimbabwean.co/2025/05/mr-president-zimbabwe-doesnt-have-a-national-dress/ \"Mr. President, Zimbabwe doesn’t have a national dress\")\n\n#### Leave a Reply\n\n[Cancel reply](https://www.thezimbabwean.co/2025/05/high-court-ends-journalist-blessed-mhlangas-two-month-prison-hell/#respond)\n\nYour email address will not be published.Required fields are marked \\*\n\nName \\*\n\nEmail \\*\n\nWebsite\n\nΔ\n\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

and heritage.\n\nBut while that message may sound noble on the surface, it misses a glaring reality: Zimbabwe, quite frankly, does not have a national dress.\n\nAt least not in the genuine, widely accepted and proudly worn sense of the term.\n\n**_To directly receive articles from Tendai Ruben Mbofana, please join his WhatsApp Channel on:_** [**_https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029VaqprWCIyPtRnKpkHe08_**](https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029VaqprWCIyPtRnKpkHe08)\n\nIn 2021, the First Lady, Auxillia Mnangagwa, launched what was officially called a “national dress competition.”\n\nThe aim was to promote the use of a specific fabric and design that could serve as Zimbabwe’s national attire.\n\nThe contest invited entries from designers across the country, and ultimately, a particular pattern and fabric were selected to represent Zimbabwe.\n\nOn paper, this appeared to be a democratic and inclusive initiative.\n\nHowever, the process was fatally flawed not because it was imposed, but because it was driven and dominated by a political figure in a nation already deeply polarized.\n\nThat, right there, is where the project lost its footing.\n\nWhat could have been a cultural milestone was undermined by its very leadership.\n\nThe fact that this initiative was fronted by the First Lady—a figure inextricably tied to the ruling establishment—instantly politicized the process.\n\nIn a country where power is tightly held and political divisions run deep, even the most well-meaning efforts are viewed through a lens of mistrust when led by those in high office.\n\nRather than being seen as a unifying cultural initiative, the national dress became associated with state power, political loyalty, and proximity to the First Family.\n\nIt stopped being a symbol of national identity and quickly became a costume of allegiance.\n\nThis is why, despite all the state-sponsored fanfare, the so-called national dress has failed to take root among ordinary Zimbabweans.\n\nIt is practically unheard of to see anyone wearing this attire in everyday life.\n\nOutside of formal state functions—especially those attended or hosted by the First Lady—the dress is almost non-existent.\n\nWhen it does appear, it is primarily in ceremonial contexts, worn by individuals clearly aligned with or involved in state activities, as was the case at today’s Cabinet meeting.\n\nTo many citizens, it is not a reflection of their culture, but a political uniform.\n\nThis outcome speaks to a broader issue about how national symbols are conceived and adopted.\n\nA national dress is more than just a piece of cloth or a fashion trend.\n\nIt is a collective expression of identity.\n\nIt reflects shared history, cultural diversity, and the values that bind a people together.\n\nAnd crucially, it must be rooted in public ownership.\n\nYou cannot manufacture national pride through press releases and patronage.\n\nYou cannot dictate symbolism from a position of power and expect automatic acceptance from a skeptical population.\n\nAcross the world, national dresses that enjoy deep public respect and emotional resonance—like the Ghanaian kente, the Nigerian agbada, Japanese kimono, or the Scottish kilt—were not created by political figures.\n\nThey emerged over time from within communities.\n\nThey were popularized organically, gaining authenticity and significance through widespread, voluntary use.\n\nWhen governments did step in to formalize these as national symbols, it was to affirm what the people had already embraced—not to prescribe or impose identity from above.\n\nZimbabwe could have followed a similar path.\n\nThis should have been a cultural initiative led by independent institutions, cultural experts, historians, designers, and community leaders—not the spouse of a sitting president.\n\nIn fact, had the First Lady taken a backseat and allowed the nation’s rich and diverse communities to drive the process, we might actually be wearing something today that we all call our own.\n\nInstead, the entire endeavour became entangled in the optics of power.\n\nJust like President Mnangagwa’s ubiquitous scarf—adorned with Zimbabwe’s national colours but perceived more as a political trademark than a symbol of unity—the national dress has come to reflect association with the ruling elite.\n\nEven its launch was mostly covered in state media and promoted through official channels, as if it were a government programme rather than a cultural movement.\n\nWe must be honest: Zimbabweans have rejected the dress not because they oppose the idea of national identity or cultural pride, but because they instinctively recognize when something has been politicized.\n\nIn a country where public trust in government is low, and where political symbolism is often weaponized, people are wary of what they are being asked to embrace.\n\nAnd when they sense that a project may be more about personal legacy-building than collective representation, they respond with apathy—or outright resistance.\n\nIt does not have to be this way.\n\nZimbabweans are not incapable of embracing national symbols.\n\nWe have done it before, and successfully.\n\nWhen the country adopted a new national anthem in 1994, the process was inclusive and non-partisan.\n\nThe lyrics were penned by the late Professor Solomon Mutswairo and the music composed by Fred Changundega—after a nationwide competition that invited Zimbabweans from all walks of life to participate.\n\nThere was no political interference or centralization of the process, and as a result, the anthem was embraced by citizens across the political and ethnic divide.\n\nToday, “Simudzai Mureza wedu WeZimbabwe” is sung with pride by all Zimbabweans—regardless of their background.\n\nIt remains a respected national symbol.\n\nThat is the model we should have followed for a national dress.\n\nAn initiative grounded in independence, shaped by public participation, and shielded from political agendas.\n\nThe current situation—where the national dress is worn only by a select few, and avoided by the general population—only confirms that we do not yet have a true national dress.\n\nWhat we have is a politically branded costume, associated with a ruling clique rather than a nation.\n\nIf we are serious about forging a national identity that includes our attire, then let us start afresh.\n\nLet cultural institutions, fashion bodies, traditional leaders, and citizens themselves drive the process.\n\nLet it be guided by consensus, heritage, and genuine representation—not by political convenience or individual ambition.\n\nUntil that happens, Mr. President, with all due respect, Zimbabwe does not have a national dress.\n\nWe have a garment born of a flawed process, worn only by a few, and ignored by the many.\n\nIt is not too late to do it right—but that will require humility, openness, and a willingness to let the people lead.\n\n- _**Tendai Ruben Mbofana is a social justice advocate and writer.

This expanded an original list of 77 people, including Mugabe, whose assets were frozen in 2003. Those on the list are also barred from travel in the United States except to United Nations functions. The new lis\n\n* * *\n\nt includes all cabinet members, their spouses and children. The US government also added the former and current directors of the Central Intelligence Organization, the army and the police. Reserve Bank Governor Gideon Gono, usually regarded as relatively moderate and reform-oriented, was also put on the list. State Security Minister Didymus Mutasa, who is also responsible for food security in the economically and politically distressed Southern African nation, said the sanctions affect the ordinary man in the street because the assistance we were getting from bilateral agreements and from world bodies like the World Bank have been stopped.\u001d US officials, including Ambassador to Zimbabwe Christopher Dell, have taken issue with Harare’s contention that the US-led sanctions are responsible for Zimbabwe’s economic collapse. Dell recently told a Zimbabwe audience that mismanagement and corruption were to blame. The White House issued a statement saying the sanctions will continue to be expanded until Zimbabwe restores democratic norms and the rule of law. Some of the notable names on the updated list include, Ignatius Chombo’s two wives, Marian and Ever. Chombo’s third wife Nannette Silukuni is not on the list. Also new on the list is Governor of the Reserve Bank Gideon Gono and his wife Hellin, Rudo Grace Charamba spouse of George Charamba, Patrick Chinamasa’s family which includes wife Monica and son Gamuchirai, the aggressive wife of the Defence Forces General Jocelyn Chiwenga and the Chairman of Zimbabwe Electoral Commission George Chiweshe. A White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said, “This action is not aimed at the people of Zimbabwe, but rather at those most responsible for their plight. The failed political and economic policies of the Robert Mugabe regime have succeeded in devastating Zimbabwe.\u001d” – VOA/SW Radio Africa, a full list of those facing sanctions is on www.thezimbabwean.co.uk\n\nPost published in: [News](https://www.thezimbabwean.co/category/news/)\n\n### Related\n\n- [Health ministry lashes out at Machakaire’s ‘unwarranted’ criticism over state of hospitals](https://www.thezimbabwean.co/2025/05/health-ministry-lashes-out-at-machakaires-unwarranted-criticism-over-state-of-hospitals/ \"Health ministry lashes out at Machakaire’s ‘unwarranted’ criticism over state of hospitals\")\n- [High Court ends journalist Blessed Mhlanga’s two-month prison hell](https://www.thezimbabwean.co/2025/05/high-court-ends-journalist-blessed-mhlangas-two-month-prison-hell/ \"High Court ends journalist Blessed Mhlanga’s two-month prison hell\")\n\n#### Leave a Reply\n\n[Cancel reply](https://www.thezimbabwean.co/2005/12/new-sanctions-list-includes-children/#respond)\n\nYour email address will not be published.Required fields are marked \\*\n\nName \\*\n\nEmail \\*\n\nWebsite\n\nΔ\n\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

The growing public outcry over our healthcare system is not an exaggeration; it reflects the difficult experiences of many citizens,” Machakaire said.\n\nThe minister also made a direct plea to President Emmerson Mnangagwa, writing: “Please find time from your busy schedule to visit these institutions yourself. There is no substitute for seeing, listening and understanding firsthand what our citizens are going through.”\n\nThe forthright comments admitting government failings by a minister surprised many, and they appear to have angered his colleague at the health ministry Douglas Mombeshora.\n\nThe health ministry said while it “recognises and respects the public’s right to express concerns—and we welcome constructive engagement from all citizens and leaders—it is vital that such discourse remains fair, balanced, and based on verified facts.”\n\nThe ministry insists the criticism is blowing the health crisis out of proportion, even as nurses this week voiced similar concerns as Machakaire.\n\n“The ministry is open to meaningful dialogue and informed critique; however, we strongly reject narratives that unfairly undermine the tireless efforts of our healthcare professionals and ignore the notable achievements underway across the country,” the statement went on.\n\nThe Zimbabwe Nurses Association on Monday decried “dire working conditions in public health institutions.”\n\n“There is a severe lack of medical resources, equipment and essential drugs,” the union said in a statement.\n\n“In the absence of these tools, nurses are unfairly being blamed by the public for delays and inefficiencies. They are overburdened by improvisation leading to long queues, slow service delivery and increased suffering of patients.”\n\nThe nurses accused the government of freezing nursing jobs while hospitals are severely understaffed.\n\n“The chronic shortage of staff is worsening the situation, with the nurse-to-patient ratio as high as 1:20 or even 1:30 in some wards,” they said. “This is unmanageable and endangers both patient care and nurse wellbeing.”\n\nIn apparent response to Machakaire’s comments, health minister Mombeshora and finance minister Mthuli Ncube on Monday toured Natpharm, the state company that supplies medicines and sundries to the country’s public hospitals.\n\nIn a statement following the visit, Natpharm said the two ministers were on a mission to “assess operational challenges affecting service delivery.”\n\n“Their visit underscores a commitment to strengthening Zimbabwe’s healthcare supply chain,” Natpharm said.\n\nPost published in: [Featured](https://www.thezimbabwean.co/category/featured/)\n\n### Related\n\n- [High Court ends journalist Blessed Mhlanga’s two-month prison hell](https://www.thezimbabwean.co/2025/05/high-court-ends-journalist-blessed-mhlangas-two-month-prison-hell/ \"High Court ends journalist Blessed Mhlanga’s two-month prison hell\")\n- [Mr. President, Zimbabwe doesn’t have a national dress](https://www.thezimbabwean.co/2025/05/mr-president-zimbabwe-doesnt-have-a-national-dress/ \"Mr. President, Zimbabwe doesn’t have a national dress\")\n\n#### Leave a Reply\n\n[Cancel reply](https://www.thezimbabwean.co/2025/05/health-ministry-lashes-out-at-machakaires-unwarranted-criticism-over-state-of-hospitals/#respond)\n\nYour email address will not be published.Required fields are marked \\*\n\nName \\*\n\nEmail \\*\n\nWebsite\n\nΔ\n\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.
