Mnangagwa Declares Gutu East And Insiza North Constituencies Vacant
President Emmerson Mnangagwa has declared the Gutu East and Insiza North constituencies vacant following the expulsion and death of their former representatives, respectively.
The Gutu East constituency was held by Benjamin Ganyiwa, who was expelled from ZANU PF for acts of indiscipline, while Insiza North was represented by the late Farai Taruvinga, who passed away last month.
The President’s announcement followed a formal notification from the Speaker of Parliament, Advocate Jacob Mudenda, on 17 April, as set out in Proclamation 3 of 2025, which was published under Statutory Instrument 44A of 2025.
This proclamation was made in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Constitution of Zimbabwe and the Electoral Act.
The Nomination Courts for the constituencies are scheduled to convene on 15 May.
