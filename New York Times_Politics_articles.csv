A Ukrainian drone attack halted flights at airports across a wide swath of Russia overnight on Tuesday, Russian officials said, showing Kyiv’s ability to strike deep into Russian territory before a planned parade in Moscow to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II in Europe.
Air defenses responded to the drone volley in at least 11 regions, the Russian Ministry of Defense reported. The attack closed 13 airports, including all four major airports serving Moscow, according to a Russian aviation agency. Flights resumed Tuesday morning.
The Ukrainian authorities have not commented on the strikes.
It was unclear whether the barrage was intended to threaten the parade, because Kyiv has been routinely shooting at Russia with long-range drones, answering the nightly Russian bombardments of Ukraine. Russian drones on Tuesday hit the cities of Sumy, Kharkiv and Odesa, killing four people and wounding at least another 24, according to local officials.
Russia has said about 20 heads of state including China’s president, Xi Jinping, have accepted invitations to the parade, in Red Square, on Friday; President Vladimir V. Putin has asked for a three-day truce in the war for the occasion.

President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine has rejected that proposal unless Russia agrees to
extend any cease-fire
for at least 30 days, calling the shorter truce too limited. He has also said that the cease-fire was offered only to put guests of the parade at ease.
