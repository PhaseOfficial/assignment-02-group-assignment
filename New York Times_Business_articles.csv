People who question whether the Earth is round — a fact understood by the ancient Greeks and taught to American children in elementary school — might have been political pariahs a decade ago. Now, they’re running local Republican parties in
Georgia
and
Minnesota
and seeking public office in
Alabama
.
A prominent far-right activist who has said, despite years of
research and intelligence
establishing
otherwise
, that the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, were
an inside job
by the U.S. government
commemorated the 9/11 anniversary
last year alongside President Trump.
And
Robert F. Kennedy Jr.,
the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services,
pledged the agency’s
support last month for a fight involving so-called
chemtrails
, a
debunked theory
that the
white condensation lines
streaming behind airplanes are toxic, or could even be used for nefarious purposes.
Conspiracy theories that were relegated to random and often anonymous online forums are now being championed or publicly debated by increasingly powerful people. Mr. Trump in particular has embraced, elevated and even appointed to his cabinet people
promoting these theories
— giving the ideas a persuasive authority and a dangerous proximity to policy.

“The real problem with the ideas and the communication of conspiracy theories is when they get evinced by people with the power to act on them,” said Joseph E. Uscinski, a professor at the University of Miami who studies conspiracy theories. “If some guy, somewhere, thinks the Earth is flat, the answer is ‘So what?’ But when people in power have those beliefs, it becomes a serious issue.”
He added: “You can wind up harming many, many people over a fantasy.”
Anna Kelly, a spokeswoman for the White House, said in a statement that the mainstream media “has tried and failed to paint President Trump as extreme for his entire political career” and that his agenda was “common sense.”
