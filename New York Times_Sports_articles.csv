Your hips are your body’s powerhouse. You rely on them to jump, run, pick up bags of groceries and get in and out of your car. But if your hips or their surrounding muscles are tight or weak, other parts of your body — from your ankles to your lower back — have to step in to handle the load. That
imbalance
can make even the simplest activities challenging or painful.
“You can think of it like driving a car with the emergency brake on,” said Ryan Matisko, a physical therapist in New York City. This can lead to inefficient movement and an increased risk of injury.
Sitting for long stretches of time is a common cause of weak hips. In that position,
your glute muscles are turned off
, your blood flow is restricted and your hip flexors become shortened and tight. Mobility exercises can help
counteract that stiffness and tension
by moving your hip joint through its full range of motion, said Nicole Thompson, a personal trainer and group fitness instructor in San Diego.
For long-term hip health, you also need to strengthen the muscles that move your hips, like the glutes, hamstrings, hip flexors and adductors. “Mobility without strength is like a bridge without support beams,” Dr. Matisko said.
